For the first day we'll concentrate on getting you introduced to the basic
structure of the class, getting your development environment setup and learning
some basics about the command line.

## Orientation

Welcome to Boom.Camp! Please watch the following video for a quick orientation
to the class.

## Programming Environment Setup

The following programs should be installed are ready to use for the duration of
this course. Go through each program here and get it installed on your
development computer.

**YOUR COMPUTER MAY ALREADY HAVE THESE PROGRAMS INSTALLED, CHECK BEFORE
INSTALLING**

### Programs

- **Web Browser** - choose one, or install both
  - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
  - [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
- **Text Editor**
  - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Version Control System

  - [Git](https://git-scm.com) - `git` is used for source code version control,
    we'll learn how to utilize it in this course.

    - **Linux Installation**

      From Terminal

      ```sh
      sudo apt install git

      # You can test the install by executing

      git --version

      # You will see the currently installed version output to the terminal
      ```

    - **Windows Installation**
      - [Git For Windows](https://gitforwindows.org)

## Command Line Basics

As a Frontend Developer it is extremely beneficial to know how to navigate and
manipulate your computer from the command line. We're going to concentrate on
commands that are related to Unix based OS's, but with the new **Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL)** most of this can be utilized even if you're using
Windows as your OS.

Another reason we need to get comfortable utilizing the command line is because
many of the tools we utilize only have a command line based interface. It's
critical you are comfortable utilizing the command line in your daily work to
succeed in this course.

## Git Basics

Git is a tool for managing and versioning source code. If you're new to software
development the importance of that task may not be apparent, but I assure you
it's a critical tool to learn as a professional software developer.

Git has swiftly become an industry standard, for software version control.
Almost any software development job these days will reqiure a working knowledge
of Git.
